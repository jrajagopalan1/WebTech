            Lauterbrunnen is a city located in the Swiss Alps. The population is a little over 2000, which is still less than the amount of undergraduated at Babson. 
            According to wikipedia, Lauterbrunnen was first mentioned in 1240 as "in claro fonte", a Romance language place name meaning "clear spring" 
            By 1253, it was known to German speakers as Liuterbrunnon; the town had an alternate spelling of Luterbrunnen by 1268. While the meaning of brunnen 
             is undoubtedly spring or fountain, there is some dispute about the meaning of lauter. Some translate it as clear, clean or bright (which compares to the 
             earlier Romance language meaning of the place mentioned above), while others translate it as "many" or "louder". A local explanation is that the name 
             Lauterbrunnen means "many springs", using a modern meaning of the word lauter in German; however, this could be an example of a folk etymology.
